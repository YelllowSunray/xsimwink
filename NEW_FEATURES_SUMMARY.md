}
```

## 💡 Tips

1. **Screen Share**: Best quality when sharing a single window vs entire screen
2. **Chat**: Messages persist during the call session only
3. **Transcription**: Works best in quiet environments with clear speech
4. **Background Blur**: May impact performance on older devices
5. **Device Switching**: Some browsers require user permission for each device

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Transcription**: Browser-dependent (Web Speech API support varies)
2. **Background Blur**: Requires decent CPU for real-time processing
3. **Screen Share**: Audio sharing depends on browser support
4. **Chat**: Messages are not persisted to database (session-only)
