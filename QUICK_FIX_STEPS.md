# Quick Fix for 404 Error ⚡

## ✅ Changes Pushed Successfully
Your fixes are now on GitHub and Vercel is deploying.

## 🔍 Check Deployment Status

### 1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
https://vercel.com/dashboard

### 2. Find Your Project
Look for the project connected to your GitHub repo

### 3. Check Deployment Status
- Look for a deployment in progress (yellow/orange indicator)
- Wait for it to complete (should take 2-5 minutes)
- Look for "Ready" status (green checkmark)

## 🚨 If Still Getting 404 After Deployment

### Option 1: Force Clean Redeploy
1. In Vercel, go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click **"..."** menu on latest deployment
3. Select **"Redeploy"**
4. **IMPORTANT:** Toggle OFF "Use existing Build Cache"
5. Click **"Redeploy"** button

This forces Vercel to build from scratch without using the old cached build.

### Option 2: Check the Build Logs
1. Click on your latest deployment
2. Click **"View Build Logs"** or **"Building"** 
3. Look for any red error messages
4. If you see errors, copy/paste them so I can help

### Option 3: Verify You're Using the Right URL
- ✅ **Correct:** `https://your-app.vercel.app`
- ❌ **Wrong:** `https://your-app.vercel.app/dashboard` (subpage directly)

**Always try the ROOT URL first!**

## 🎯 What Should Happen

Once deployed successfully:
1. Visit `https://your-app-name.vercel.app`
2. You should see the Wink sign-in page
3. No more 404 error!

## 📊 Current Fixes Applied

✅ Removed `--turbopack` from build script  
✅ Configured `outputFileTracingRoot` in next.config.ts  
✅ Build tested locally (works perfectly)  
✅ Changes pushed to GitHub  
✅ Vercel auto-deploy triggered  

## ⏱️ Timeline

- **Now:** Vercel is building your app
- **2-5 min:** Build should complete
- **After build:** Visit your Vercel URL

## 🔔 What to Do Next

1. **Wait 5 minutes** for Vercel to finish building
2. **Refresh** your Vercel app URL
3. **Try Ctrl+Shift+R** (hard refresh) to clear browser cache
4. **If still 404:** Force redeploy without cache (Option 1 above)

## 💡 Most Common Cause

**Vercel cached the old broken build!**

Solution: Force redeploy WITHOUT build cache (see Option 1)

## 🆘 Still Stuck?

Share this info:
1. Your Vercel deployment URL
2. Screenshot of the build logs
3. Whether the build shows "Ready" or "Failed"

---

**The fixes ARE applied.** The 404 is likely just Vercel using an old cached build. Force a clean redeploy and it should work! 🚀
