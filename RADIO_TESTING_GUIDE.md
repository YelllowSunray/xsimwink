## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No sound on one device
**Solution**: Check device volume, unmute, check browser audio permissions

### Issue: Stations not syncing
**Solution**: Refresh both pages, ensure both are in the same call

### Issue: Stream won't load
**Solution**: Try a different station (some streams may be temporarily down)

### Issue: Linter errors about publishData
**Solution**: These are false positives. The code uses the correct format:
```typescript
room?.localParticipant?.publishData(data, { 
  reliable: true,
  topic: 'radio-control'
});
```
