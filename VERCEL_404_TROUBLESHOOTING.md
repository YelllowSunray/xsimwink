# Vercel 404 Error - Complete Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status
- ✅ Build works locally (tested successfully)
- ✅ package.json fixed (no turbopack)
- ✅ next.config.ts configured with outputFileTracingRoot
- ❌ Still getting 404 on Vercel

## Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: configure Next.js for Vercel deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Check Vercel Build Logs
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Click on the latest deployment
5. Click "View Build Logs"

**Look for:**
- ❌ Any red error messages
- ❌ "Build failed" status
- ⚠️ Warnings about missing files
- ✅ "Build Completed" with green checkmark

### Step 3: Force Redeploy on Vercel
Sometimes Vercel caches the broken build. Force a fresh deploy:

**Option A: From Vercel Dashboard**
1. Go to Deployments
2. Click "..." menu on the latest deployment
3. Click "Redeploy"
4. Select "Use existing Build Cache: OFF"
5. Click "Redeploy"

**Option B: From Git**
```bash
# Make a trivial change to force redeploy
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: force Vercel redeploy"
git push origin main
```

### Step 4: Check Your Vercel URL
Make sure you're accessing the correct URL:

- **Correct:** `https://your-app-name.vercel.app`
- **Incorrect:** `https://your-app-name.vercel.app/some-page`

Try accessing the root URL first: `https://your-app-name.vercel.app/`

### Step 5: Check Vercel Project Settings

Go to: **Project Settings → General**

Verify these settings:
- **Framework Preset:** Next.js
- **Build Command:** `npm run build` (or leave default)
- **Output Directory:** `.next` (or leave default)
- **Install Command:** `npm install` (or leave default)
- **Node.js Version:** 18.x or 20.x (latest LTS)

### Step 6: Check Environment Variables (if needed)

Go to: **Project Settings → Environment Variables**

Your Firebase config has defaults, so you might not need these, but if you want custom settings:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyDl7J_X8jHinJrsS8_lqbwW5GNuhCoWeuo
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=xoxo-53066.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=xoxo-53066
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=xoxo-53066.firebasestorage.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=832070586009
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:832070586009:web:f30ef934d04538ecfb3208
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-17Z126NS7J
```

**Important:** After adding environment variables, you MUST redeploy!

### Step 7: Clear Vercel Cache

If the problem persists, clear all caches:

1. Go to **Project Settings → General**
2. Scroll to "Danger Zone"
3. Look for cache-related options
4. Or simply delete and recreate the Vercel project (last resort)

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Wrong Git Branch
**Problem:** Vercel is deploying the wrong branch
**Solution:**
1. Go to **Project Settings → Git**
2. Check "Production Branch" is set to `main` (or your main branch)
3. Redeploy

### Issue 2: Build Output Missing
**Problem:** Build succeeds but .next folder is empty
**Solution:**
- Check build logs for "Error: Could not find a production build"
- Make sure `output` is NOT set to `export` in next.config.ts
- Ensure `.next` directory is not in `.gitignore`

### Issue 3: Route Not Found
**Problem:** Root loads but subpages show 404
**Solution:**
- This is expected for Next.js App Router
- Make sure you have `src/app/page.tsx` (root page)
- Check that pages are in `src/app/` directory (not `pages/`)

### Issue 4: Old Build Cached
**Problem:** Changes don't appear after deployment
**Solution:**
1. Clear Vercel cache (redeploy without cache)
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Try in incognito/private browsing mode

### Issue 5: Package Lock File Conflicts
**Problem:** Multiple lockfiles detected (shown in build logs)
**Solution:**
This is just a warning and shouldn't cause 404, but to fix:
```bash
# Remove extra lockfile at C:\Users\Me\package-lock.json
# Keep only the one in your project directory
```

## Debugging Commands

### Test Local Production Build
```bash
# Clean build
rm -rf .next node_modules
npm install
npm run build
npm start

# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

### Check Build Output
```bash
npm run build

# Should show:
# ✓ Compiled successfully
# ✓ Linting and checking validity of types
# ✓ Collecting page data
# ✓ Generating static pages (X/X)
# ✓ Finalizing page optimization
```

### Verify Git Status
```bash
git status
# Should show: working tree clean (after commit)

git log --oneline -3
# Should show your latest commits
```

## What to Share If Still Stuck

If the 404 persists, share these details:

1. **Vercel Deployment URL:** `https://your-app-name.vercel.app`
2. **Build Log:** Copy/paste from Vercel dashboard
3. **Error Message:** Exact 404 error details
4. **Build Status:** Success or Failed?
5. **Which route fails:** Root (/) or specific page?

## Expected Behavior After Fix

Once fixed, you should see:
1. ✅ Vercel shows "Build Completed" (green)
2. ✅ Deployment marked as "Ready"
3. ✅ Visiting URL shows the Wink app (sign-in page if not logged in)
4. ✅ No 404 error

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] package.json has `"build": "next build"` (no --turbopack)
- [ ] next.config.ts has outputFileTracingRoot configured
- [ ] Changes committed and pushed to Git
- [ ] Vercel shows latest commit is deployed
- [ ] Build logs show "Build Completed" 
- [ ] Framework set to "Next.js" in Vercel settings
- [ ] Tried accessing root URL (not a subpage)
- [ ] Cleared browser cache
- [ ] Tried redeploying without build cache

## Last Resort: Recreate Vercel Project

If nothing works:

1. **Export environment variables** (if any)
2. **Delete Vercel project**
3. **Create new project:**
   - Import from Git
   - Select your repository
   - Framework: Next.js (auto-detected)
   - Root Directory: `./` (project root)
   - Click Deploy

This forces a completely fresh deployment.

## Contact Information

If you're stuck, the issue is likely one of:
1. Cached old build on Vercel → Redeploy without cache
2. Wrong URL being accessed → Try root URL
3. Build actually failing → Check build logs for errors
4. Wrong branch deployed → Check Git settings

Share your Vercel build logs for more specific help!
