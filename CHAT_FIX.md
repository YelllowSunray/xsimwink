# Chat Message Differentiation Fix

## Problem
When messaging someone in a video call, users couldn't differentiate who sent which message. Both users would see "You" as the sender for all messages, making the conversation confusing.

## Root Cause
When sending a chat message, the code was broadcasting `sender: 'You'` to the other participant. This meant:
- **User A sends message**: Shows as "You" on their screen ✅
- **User B receives message**: Also shows as "You" on their screen ❌

Both users saw all messages labeled as "You", making it impossible to tell who said what.

## Solution

### 1. Send Actual Identity, Display Contextually

**File: `src/components/VideoChatLiveKit.tsx`**

Changed the logic to:
- **Send**: Broadcast the actual user identity (user ID)
- **Display locally**: Show as "You" for your own messages
- **Display remotely**: Show as partner's name for received messages

**Before:**
```typescript
const messageData = {
  sender: 'You', // ❌ Always sends 'You'
  message: chatInput,
  timestamp: Date.now()
};
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Get local participant's identity (user ID)
const localIdentity = room.localParticipant?.identity || 'Unknown';

const messageData = {
  sender: localIdentity, // ✅ Send actual identity
  message: chatInput,
  timestamp: Date.now()
};

// Add to local messages with 'You' as display name
setChatMessages(prev => [...prev, {
  ...messageData,
  sender: 'You' // ✅ Display as 'You' locally
}]);
```

### 2. Smart Display Name Handling

When receiving messages:
```typescript
// Get the sender's identity
const senderIdentity = data.sender;
const localIdentity = room?.localParticipant?.identity;

// Determine display name based on who sent it
const displayName = senderIdentity === localIdentity ? 'You' : partnerName;
```

This ensures:
- Your own messages show as "You"
- Partner's messages show with their actual name

### 3. Improved Visual Design

Enhanced the chat UI for better clarity:

**Color-coded names:**
- Your messages: Green label (`#10b981`)
- Partner's messages: Pink label (`#f472b6`)

**Message bubbles:**
- Your messages: Green gradient, aligned right, rounded bottom-right corner sharp
- Partner's messages: Gray gradient, aligned left, rounded bottom-left corner sharp

**Modern chat styling:**
- iMessage-style bubbles with rounded corners
- Clear visual separation between senders
- Max width 75% for readability
- Word wrapping for long messages

### 4. Auto-Scroll to New Messages

Added automatic scrolling so new messages are always visible:
```typescript
// Auto-scroll chat to bottom when new messages arrive
React.useEffect(() => {
  chatMessagesEndRef.current?.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' });
}, [chatMessages]);
```

## How It Works Now

### Sending a Message
1. User types message and clicks Send
2. Message is added locally with label "You"
3. Actual user ID is broadcast to partner
4. Partner receives and displays with sender's actual name

### Visual Appearance

**Your messages (right side):**
```
                You (green text)
     [Your message here] (green bubble)
```

**Partner's messages (left side):**
```
Partner Name (pink text)
[Their message here] (gray bubble)
```

## Benefits

✅ **Clear identification**: Always know who sent what  
✅ **Familiar UX**: Similar to iMessage/WhatsApp  
✅ **Color coding**: Quick visual differentiation  
✅ **Auto-scroll**: Never miss new messages  
✅ **Responsive**: Works on mobile and desktop  
✅ **Word wrap**: Long messages display properly  

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. **Start a video call** between two users
2. **Open chat** on both sides
3. **Send messages** from both users
4. **Verify**:
   - Your messages appear on the right in green
   - Partner's messages appear on the left in gray
   - Names are clearly labeled above each message
   - New messages auto-scroll into view

## Files Changed

- `src/components/VideoChatLiveKit.tsx` - Fixed chat message sender identification and styling

## Notes

- Only the LiveKit video chat component has chat functionality
- The other video components (VideoChat.tsx, VideoChat100ms.tsx) don't have chat features yet
- This fix works for both 1-on-1 and group calls
