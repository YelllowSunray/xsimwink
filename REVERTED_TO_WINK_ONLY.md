# ✅ Reverted to Wink-Only Implementation

## What's Active Now

Your app is back to the clean, working state with **only winking** as the gesture feature:

### ✅ **Working Features:**
1. **Eye Contact Detection** 👁️ - Tracks mutual gaze
2. **Wink Detection** 😉 - Detects left/right eye winks
3. **LiveKit Sync** - Both features synchronized between participants
4. **Animations** - Floating emoji animations for winks

---

## 🧹 What Was Removed

### Removed from Face Detection:
- ❌ Tongue out detection
- ❌ Kiss detection  
- ❌ Big smile detection
- ❌ Surprise detection

### Cleaned Files:
- ✅ `src/hooks/useEyeContactDetection.ts` - Only winking now
- ✅ `src/hooks/useLiveKitEyeContact.ts` - Only winking synced
- ✅ `src/components/LiveKitEyeContactOverlay.tsx` - Only wink animations

### Hand Gestures:
- Code still exists in `src/hooks/useHandGestureDetection.ts`
- **Fixed the typo!** (peaceSignStateRef)
- Not integrated with LiveKit (not synced between participants)
- Available for testing at `/test-gestures`

---

## 🎯 Current System Status

```typescript
// Face Detection (useEyeContactDetection.ts)
interface EyeContactStatus {
  isLookingAtCamera: boolean;
  confidence: number;
  isWinking: boolean;
  winkEye: 'left' | 'right' | null;
}

// LiveKit Sync (useLiveKitEyeContact.ts)  
interface GazeData {
  gazeX: number;
  gazeY: number;
  isLooking: boolean;
  confidence: number;
  timestamp: number;
  isWinking: boolean;
  winkEye: 'left' | 'right' | null;
}
```

**Simple. Clean. Working.** 😉

---

## 📱 How to Use

### In Your Video Calls:
1. Start a LiveKit video call
2. Wink at the camera
3. See the 😉 emoji float up!
4. Your partner sees your wink too!

### Test Page:
- Go to `/test-eye-contact` - Test wink in video call context
- Go to `/test-gestures` - Test all detection (including hand gestures, though they won't sync)

---

## 🎨 What's Still Available (Not Integrated)

The hand gesture detection code exists and works:
- ✌️ Peace Sign
- 👍 Thumbs Up  
- 🤘 Rock On
- 👌 OK Sign

These detect locally but don't sync to remote participants. They're in the codebase if you ever want to integrate them.

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Wink Detection:
- **Method:** MediaPipe Face Landmarker blendshapes
- **Threshold:** Closed eye > 0.60, Open eye < 0.45
- **Duration:** 150ms - 800ms
- **Cooldown:** 800ms between detections
- **Detection Rate:** ~10 FPS (throttled for performance)

### LiveKit Integration:
- **Channel:** `"eye-contact"` data channel
- **Protocol:** Unreliable (low latency)
- **Data:** Gaze position + wink status
- **Updates:** ~10 times per second

## 📊 File Structure

```
src/
├── hooks/
│   ├── useEyeContactDetection.ts ✅ (Wink only)
│   ├── useLiveKitEyeContact.ts ✅ (Wink synced)
│   └── useHandGestureDetection.ts ⚠️ (Not integrated)
├── components/
│   └── LiveKitEyeContactOverlay.tsx ✅ (Wink animations)
└── app/
    ├── test-eye-contact/page.tsx ✅ (Wink testing)
    └── test-gestures/page.tsx ⚠️ (All gestures, local only)
```

✅ = Active and synced  
⚠️ = Available but not synced

---

## 🎉 Bottom Line

**You're back to a clean, simple implementation:**
- ✅ Eye contact works
- ✅ Winking works  
- ✅ Both sync between participants
- ✅ Beautiful animations
- ✅ No extra complexity

**Bonus:** Hand gesture detection code is still there (with the typo fixed!) if you ever want it.

---

## 📝 Next Steps (Optional)

If you want to add more gestures later:
1. They're easy to add back
2. The architecture supports it
3. Just let me know!

For now, enjoy your clean wink feature! 😉✨
