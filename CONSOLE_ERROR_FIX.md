# Console Error Fix - TensorFlow Lite INFO Messages ðŸ”‡

## Problem

When the app initialized MediaPipe for eye contact and wink detection, you would see this misleading error in the console:

```
INFO: Created TensorFlow Lite XNNPACK delegate for CPU.
```

This appeared as a **console.error** even though it's actually just an **informational message** from TensorFlow Lite (not an error at all).

## Root Cause

- MediaPipe uses TensorFlow Lite for face detection
- TensorFlow Lite outputs INFO-level logs when it initializes
- Next.js captures these logs and displays them as errors in the console
- This creates confusion because it looks like something is broken (but it's not!)

## Solution

Created a console filter that:
1. Intercepts `console.error()` and `console.warn()` calls
2. Checks if the message is a known TensorFlow Lite INFO message
3. Suppresses those specific messages
4. Allows all other errors/warnings through normally

## Files Changed

### New Files Created

1. **`src/utils/consoleFilter.ts`**
   - Utility that filters out TensorFlow Lite INFO messages
   - Wraps the native console methods
   - Can be easily extended to filter other known non-error messages

2. **`src/components/ConsoleFilterInit.tsx`**
   - Client component that initializes the filter on mount
   - Runs once when the app starts

### Modified Files

3. **`src/app/layout.tsx`**
   - Added `ConsoleFilterInit` component
   - Filter is now active across the entire app

## How It Works

```
1. App starts
   â†“
2. ConsoleFilterInit component mounts
   â†“
3. initConsoleFilter() wraps console.error/warn
   â†“
4. TensorFlow Lite logs "INFO: Created XNNPACK delegate..."
   â†“
5. Filter catches it and suppresses it
   â†“
6. Clean console! ðŸŽ‰
```

## Benefits

âœ… Cleaner console output  
âœ… Less confusion about "errors" that aren't actually errors  
âœ… Real errors are still visible  
âœ… Easy to extend to filter other known messages  
âœ… Zero impact on performance  

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open the app in a browser
3. Open browser dev tools console
4. Navigate to a page that uses eye contact detection (video chat)
5. The TensorFlow Lite INFO message should NOT appear
6. Other real errors should still appear normally

## Notes

- This only filters console output in the browser
- The underlying TensorFlow Lite functionality works exactly the same
- Real errors from MediaPipe/TensorFlow will still show up
- The filter is applied globally at app startup

## Future Improvements

If you see other misleading INFO messages, you can add them to the `FILTERED_MESSAGES` array in `src/utils/consoleFilter.ts`:

```typescript
const FILTERED_MESSAGES = [
  'INFO: Created TensorFlow Lite XNNPACK delegate for CPU',
  'Created TensorFlow Lite XNNPACK delegate for CPU',
  'XNNPACK delegate',
  'YOUR_NEW_MESSAGE_HERE', // Add more here
];
```

**Status:** âœ… Fixed - Console is now clean and only shows real errors!
