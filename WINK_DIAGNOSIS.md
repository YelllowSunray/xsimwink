# 😉 Wink Detection Diagnosis

## ✅ What's Working

### `/test-wink` Page Works!
- ✅ MediaPipe loads correctly
- ✅ Face detection works
- ✅ Wink detection is functional
- ✅ Both blendshapes and EAR methods work

**Conclusion:** The detection algorithms are 100% working.

---

## ❌ What's NOT Working

### LiveKit Integration (`/test-eye-contact`)
Winks not being detected when in actual LiveKit video call.

---

## 🔍 Likely Issues

### Issue 1: Video Element Not Attached
**Problem:** LiveKit's `VideoTrack` component may not expose the video element properly.

**Check:**
```javascript
// In console during LiveKit call:
console.log(localVideoRef.current); // Should be HTMLVideoElement
console.log(remoteVideoRef.current); // Should be HTMLVideoElement
```

**Expected:** HTMLVideoElement objects  
**If null/undefined:** Video refs not attached correctly

---

### Issue 2: Detection Not Starting
**Problem:** Face detection loop might not be running in LiveKit context.

**Check console for:**
```
✅ Local video element attached: 640 x 480
✅ Remote video element attached: 640 x 480
⚠️ Face landmarker not initialized
⚠️ Local video element not available
⚠️ Video not ready, readyState: X
```

---

### Issue 3: LiveKit Room Context Issues
**Problem:** `useRoomContext()` might not be providing proper room access.

**Check:**
```javascript
// Should see in console:
console.log(room); // LiveKit Room object
console.log(room.localParticipant); // Your participant
```

---

## 🛠️ Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Join LiveKit Call
Go to `/test-eye-contact` and join a call.

### Step 2: Open Console (F12)
Watch for these logs:

**Good signs:**
```
✅ Local video element attached: 640 x 480
✅ Remote video element attached: 640 x 480
👁️ BLINK VALUES - Left: 0.12 Right: 0.08 ...
```

**Bad signs:**
```
⚠️ Face landmarker not initialized
⚠️ Local video element not available
⚠️ Video not ready
(or NO LOGS AT ALL)
```

### Step 3: Check Video Refs
In console, type:
```javascript
// Get the component refs (you might need to expose these)
// Or look for errors like "Cannot read property 'current' of null"
```

### Step 4: Try Winking
Close one eye and watch console.

**If working:** Flood of blink values  
**If broken:** No logs or only initialization logs

## 🔧 Fixes to Try

### Fix 1: Ensure Video Elements Are Ready

The issue might be timing - video elements need to be attached AND playing before detection starts.

**Already added:**
- Console logs when video elements attach
- Diagnostic warnings in detect loop

### Fix 2: Direct Video Element Access

Instead of relying on refs, we might need to query the DOM directly:

```typescript
// Fallback method
const videoElements = document.querySelectorAll('video');
const localVideo = videoElements[0]; // Usually local
const remoteVideo = videoElements[1]; // Usually remote
```

### Fix 3: Delay Detection Start

Maybe face detection is starting before video is ready:

```typescript
setTimeout(() => {
  initializeFaceLandmarker();
}, 2000); // Wait 2 seconds after video starts
```

## 📊 Comparison

| Feature | `/test-wink` | `/test-eye-contact` |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| MediaPipe loads | ✅ Works | ? Unknown |
| Face detection | ✅ Works | ? Unknown |
| Wink detection | ✅ Works | ❌ Not working |
| Video element | ✅ Direct ref | ⚠️ Via LiveKit |
| Console logs | ✅ Visible | ? Check |

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Join LiveKit call** at `/test-eye-contact`
2. **Open console** and watch for:
   - Video attachment logs
   - Face landmarker initialization
   - Blink value logs
3. **Try winking** and see if ANY logs appear
4. **Report back:**
   - Do you see "✅ Local video element attached"?
   - Do you see "✅ Remote video element attached"?
   - Do you see ANY "👁️ BLINK VALUES" logs?
   - Do you see "⚠️" warnings?

---

## 💡 Theory

Since `/test-wink` works perfectly, the issue is **NOT**:
- ❌ MediaPipe installation
- ❌ Face detection algorithm
- ❌ Wink detection logic
- ❌ Browser compatibility

The issue **IS**:
- ✅ LiveKit video element integration
- ✅ Timing (video ready vs detection start)
- ✅ React refs not populating correctly

Most likely: **Video refs are null** when detection tries to start.

---

## 🚀 Quick Test

In the LiveKit call, press F12 and paste:

```javascript
// Check if videos exist in DOM
console.log('All videos:', document.querySelectorAll('video'));

// Try to manually trigger detection on first video
const video = document.querySelector('video');
console.log('First video:', video);
console.log('Video ready?', video?.readyState);
console.log('Video dimensions:', video?.videoWidth, 'x', video?.videoHeight);
```

This will tell us if the problem is with refs or if videos aren't rendering at all.
